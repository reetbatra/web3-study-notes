# Gas fees and transactions

## Transaction Fee
- **Definition:** The amount paid to the block producer (miner/validator) for processing a transaction.
- **Units:** Paid in Ether (ETH) or its smaller unit, GWei (1 Ether = 1,000,000,000 GWei).
- **Importance:** Incentivizes miners/validators to process transactions.

## Gas Price
- **Definition:** The cost per unit of gas required for a transaction.
- **Units:** Also specified in Ether or GWei.
- **Impact:** A higher gas price increases the likelihood of a transaction being processed quickly.

## Gas
- **Definition:** Represents the computational effort needed to execute a transaction.
- **Example:** Sending Ether is a simple transaction requiring less gas, while deploying a smart contract is more complex and requires more gas.

## Calculating Transaction Fee
- **Formula:** `Transaction fee = Gas Price * Gas Used`
- **Example:** If the gas price is 20 GWei and the transaction uses 21,000 units of gas, the transaction fee is 20 * 21,000 = 420,000 GWei or 0.00042 Ether.

# The Role of Nodes in Blockchain

## Nodes
- **Definition:** Computers running the blockchain network.
- **Types:** Miners (Proof of Work) or Validators (Proof of Stake).
- **Reward:** Receive the native currency of the blockchain for processing transactions (e.g., Ether for Ethereum).

## Incentives
- **Purpose:** Encourages people to run nodes and maintain the blockchain network.

# Understanding Gas in Transactions

## Gas in Transactions
- **Definition:** A measure of the computational work required for a transaction.
- **Complexity:** Simple transactions (like sending Ether) need less gas, while complex ones (like deploying a smart contract) need more.
- **Example:**
  - **Simple Transaction:** Sending 1 ETH to a friend may use 21,000 gas.
  - **Complex Transaction:** Deploying a new smart contract might use 1,000,000 gas.

# Example Transaction

- **Sending 0.5 ETH to a friend.**
- MetaMask suggests a gas price of 20 GWei.
- The gas limit is 21,000.
- **Calculation:** Transaction Fee = 20 GWei * 21,000 = 420,000 GWei or 0.00042 ETH.
- **Total amount deducted:** 0.5 ETH (to friend) + 0.00042 ETH (transaction fee).
